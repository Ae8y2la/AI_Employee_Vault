# 📘 Company Handbook

Welcome to the **AI Employee Vault** — your centralized hub for AI-driven task management and automation.

## 🏗️ Vault Structure

| Folder         | Purpose                                                    |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Inbox/`       | Incoming tasks and notes that need triage                  |
| `Needs_Action/`| Items that have been triaged and require action            |
| `Done/`        | Completed tasks and archived items                         |
| `Agents/`      | AI agent scripts, logic, and reasoning modules             |

## 📌 Key Principles

1. **Single Source of Truth** — All tasks flow through this vault.
2. **Inbox Zero** — Items in `Inbox/` should be triaged promptly.
3. **Automation First** — Agent scripts in `Agents/` handle repetitive work.
4. **Transparency** — Every action is logged and traceable via markdown notes.

## 🔄 Workflow

```
Inbox → Needs_Action → Done
```

- New items land in **Inbox**.
- After triage, actionable items move to **Needs_Action**.
- Once completed, items are moved to **Done**.

## 🤖 Agents

All AI logic lives in the `Agents/` folder. Agent scripts are responsible for:

- Classifying and routing incoming tasks
- Performing automated actions
- Generating summaries and reports

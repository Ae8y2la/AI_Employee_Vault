# Synthetic Platinum Tier Test

## Objective
Validate the complete Platinum pipeline from Inbox → Done, testing:

1. **Perception:** Inbox watcher detects this file
2. **Routing:** Task router classifies and moves to `/Needs_Action/`
3. **Reasoning:** Reasoning loop generates `Plan.md`
4. **Cloud Draft:** Cloud agent creates draft in `/Pending_Approval/`
5. **Local Approval:** Local agent executes after approval
6. **Logging:** All actions recorded in `/Logs/`
7. **Claim-by-Move:** No double-work between agents

## Test Data
- Invoice: #9901 for $3,750 from vendor@test.com
- Action Required: Draft a reply confirming receipt
- Domain: email
- Expected Flow: Inbox → Needs_Action → Plan → Pending_Approval → Approved → Done

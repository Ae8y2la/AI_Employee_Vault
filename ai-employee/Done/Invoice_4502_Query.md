# Urgent - Invoice #4502 Payment Query

From: client@example.com
To: ceo@company.com

Dear CEO,

I'm writing regarding Invoice #4502 for $5,200 dated Feb 10th.
Could you confirm the payment was processed? Our records show
it as still outstanding.

Please respond ASAP as our quarterly close is this Friday.

Best regards,
Client Finance Team
